# FixRanger - Connecting Local Handymen/Handywomen with Users

##  Project Description:

FixRanger is a mobile application developed using Flutter/Dart that seamlessly connects local handymen/handywomen (referred to as FixRangers) with people in need of their services. The app leverages Firebase's BaaS services, such as Cloud Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting, to provide a robust and scalable solution for this on-demand platform. As a personal project, FixRanger showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy a full-featured mobile application.

## Key Features:

### Two-portal system: 
FixRanger offers separate portals for users and FixRangers, providing tailored experiences and functionality for each group.

### Real-time data synchronization: 
Cloud Firestore and RT Database integration ensures that users and FixRangers receive real-time updates on job statuses and availabilities.

### Authentication and security: 
Firebase Authentication ensures a secure sign-up and login process, protecting user data and maintaining platform integrity.

### Job matching algorithm: 
Implemented a customized job-matching algorithm that connects users with the most suitable FixRangers based on location, skill set, and availability.


## Metrics:

####  Developed a total of 20 - 25 screens for both user and FixRanger portals, offering an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.
####  Successfully tested the app on both Android and iOS devices, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
####  Handled multiple simulated concurrent users during load testing to ensure the app's scalability and performance.


##  Technical Stack:

### Front-end: 
Flutter and Dart for cross-platform mobile app development.

### Back-end: 
Firebase BaaS services (Cloud Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting) for real-time data management, user authentication, and hosting.

### Version Control: 
Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.


##  Project Repository:

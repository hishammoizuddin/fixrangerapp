##  Project Description:

FixRanger is a mobile application developed using Flutter/Dart that seamlessly connects local handymen/handywomen (referred to as FixRangers) with people in need of their services. The app leverages Firebase's BaaS services, such as Cloud Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting, to provide a robust and scalable solution for this on-demand platform. As a personal project, FixRanger showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy a full-featured mobile application.

## Key Features:

### Two-portal system: 
FixRanger offers separate portals for users and FixRangers, providing tailored experiences and functionality for each group.

### Real-time data synchronization: 
Cloud Firestore and RT Database integration ensures that users and FixRangers receive real-time updates on job statuses and availabilities.

### Authentication and security: 
Firebase Authentication ensures a secure sign-up and login process, protecting user data and maintaining platform integrity.

### Job matching algorithm: 
Implemented a customized job-matching algorithm that connects users with the most suitable FixRangers based on location, skill set, and availability.
